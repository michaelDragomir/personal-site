							I am a full-stack software engineer with a knack for turning lines
							of code into engaging user experiences. My journey started at
							Motortrend, where I worked with amazing engineers building web
							applications and services for a high-traffic platform. We served
							two million unique weekly viewers. I thrived on the challenges of
							developing robust systems, from building streaming applications to
							working on multi-variant React apps. But my passion for sharing
							knowledge and empowering others led me down a new path.

							Now, I'm a career coach, mentor, and educator at Coding Temple,

							believe that strong technical skills are just one piece of the
							puzzle; a successful career also requires effective communication,
							problem-solving, and a growth mindset. I'm dedicated to fostering
							these qualities in my students, drawing from my own diverse
							experiences in the tech industry.

						<p>
							Outside of coding and coaching, I'm a lifelong learner with an
