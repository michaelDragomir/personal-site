						Hi there! I'm John Doe, a passionate software engineer with a
						diverse background and a wide range of interests. I've been working
						in the tech industry for over a decade, and during that time, I've
						had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects, from web
						applications to mobile apps and everything in between.
					</p>
					<p>
						My journey in the world of technology began when I was just a kid,
						tinkering with computers and learning to code. I've always been
						fascinated by the way technology can be used to solve problems and
						improve people's lives. That's why I decided to pursue a career in
						software engineering, where I could put my problem-solving skills
						and creativity to the test.
					</p>
					<p>
						Over the years, I've had the chance to work with some amazing teams
						and collaborate with talented individuals from all over the world.
						I've learned a lot along the way, and I'm always eager to continue
						expanding my knowledge and skills. Whether it's exploring new
						programming languages, diving into the latest frameworks and
						technologies, or tackling complex technical challenges, I'm always
						up for a new adventure.
					</p>
					<p>
						When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the great outdoors,
						reading a good book, or trying my hand at a new hobby. I'm a
						passionate traveler, and I love to immerse myself in different
						cultures and learn about the world around me. I'm also an avid
						photographer, and I enjoy capturing the beauty of the natural world
						through my lens.
					</p>
					<p>
						Overall, I'm a curious and driven individual who is always striving
						to learn and grow. I'm excited to connect with others who share my
						passion for technology and innovation, and I look forward to
						collaborating on exciting new projects in the future.

// 				others achieve their goals and aspirations to work in this exciting
// 				and dynamic field.

// 				I joined the Disney+ web team as a senior engineer slightly more
// 				than a year after Disney+ was launched. Some contributions I made
// 				included building out the age verification system used in South
// 				Korea, facilitated backward incompatible API migrations, and
// 				produced new releases and production deployments. Tech used included
// 				React, NodeJS and GraphQL. The next team I joined (Content
// 				Discovery) built the Disney Streaming Design System. It was a fun
// 				project that included building a standalone multi-variant NPM
// 				package currently still in use. In addition to building the tool, we
// 				scoured every nook and cranny of the Disney+ codebase integrating
// 				the design system, one CSS class at a time. Tech used here was
// 				primarily SASS and NodeJS. More recently Iâ€™ve been fortunate enough
// 				to work on and lead greenfield projects covering a variety of
// 				codebases and platforms, including mobile and TV devices. Projects
// 				that I hope I can share with the world soon. Motortrend (Discovery
// 				Communications) 2018 - 2020 I joined Motortrend right after
// 				Discovery acquired the business in 2018. <br />I was the 4th hire on
// 				the Connected Devices team and represented JavaScript platforms.
// 				During my time at Motortrend, I had the privilege of working on
// 				Discoveryâ€™s custom TV framework that powered all their browser-based
// 				TVs, STBs, and gaming consoles. I built the Motortrend On Demand
// 				streaming app using this framework for Xbox, Android TV, FireTV,
// 				Comcast STBs, and Samsung. I also maintained a high traffic
// 				multi-variant React Native app called Buyer's Guide and Automobile.
// 				During this time I also supported Discovery brands like the
// 				Eurosport Player, Food Network Kitchen and worked on the Discovery+
// 				AdTech SDK (living room devices) during its development as a
// 				maintainer/ contributor of the core framework. <br />
// 				HOTB Software 2017 - 2018 HOTB Software is a software and investment
// 				firm that helps get startups off the ground. I was hired as a React
// 				Native developer and built a cross-platform iOS/Android app called
// 				FlipTix, a platform that "flips" time left on live event tickets. I
// 				architected and built the mobile app, and handled the app store
// 				submissions and internal enterprise distributions. Topflight Apps
// 				Early 2017 Topflight Apps was my first coding gig. I worked mostly
// 				on Wordpress sites, extending themes, improving UI or fixing bugs. I
// 				also migrated a MySQL database which scared me to death at the time.
// 				Till this day I am grateful to Joe Tuan for this opportunity, he
// 				took the risk and hired a self-taught dev and it changed the course
// 				of my life significantly. Development I enjoy building for the
// 				frontend. I love learning about consumer devices and the hardware
// 				that powers them. Building for such a variety of devices has
// 				ultimately made me a better developer. If youâ€™ve built for Samsung
// 				2016 TVs, Iâ€™m sure you would agree ðŸ˜‰. <br />I use React for
// 				building UIs when not building for TV. I am familiar with it and its
// 				inner workings. I have tried building a renderer for it in Rust,
// 				using Netflixâ€™s React Gibbon (C++ with a JS view layer architecture)
// 				as inspiration, but Rustâ€™s memory safeness made it very difficult.
// 				For better or worse, I have learned a lot from React and it has
// 				influenced my frontend work more than any other codebase. Iâ€™ve been
// 				playing around with Svelteâ€™s Repl though, and am intrigued to learn
// 				more. There was a time where <br />I was excited about building the
// 				entire stack from the ground up, but these days services like Vercel
// 				and Netlify make it too easy to build, deploy and manage something
// 				quick (for personal projects of course). Iâ€™ve used NextJS
// 				extensively both at Disney and in my side projects. I built
// 				ask-carl.com using NextJS deployed to Vercel, and my current project
// 				bugchain.io is built with RedwoodJS and deployed to Vercel as well.
// 				I have built my own self-hosted infrastructure and deployment/data
// 				pipelines too, mostly on AWS. Redwood is an opinionated framework
// 				built on React, Node, GraphQL, and Prisma and has quite literally
// 				reduced my coding time by half (a single command builds the REST
// 				endpoints, forms, and GraphQL queries for a given database model). I
// 				am a big fan of functional programming. I am by no means a master,
// 				but I apply concepts like composition, piping, and point-free in my
// 				work whenever possible. JavaScriptâ€™s feature of creating closures
// 				lends itself beautifully to the FP paradigm. I also like RxJS (and
// 				reactive programming in general), it is one of the best libraries
// 				Iâ€™ve used and extremely useful for event-driven (like video players)
// 				programs. Tooling-wise, Iâ€™ve been using Rollup for standalone NPM
// 				libraries and packages, and Vite (love it!) for applications and
// 				sites, but Iâ€™ve used Webpack more in production (Webpack + Yarn
// 				Workspaces = awesome DX). Contact If youâ€™re looking for a solid
// 				frontend staff level engineer for your team or a technical
// 				co-founder to build an impressive MVP Iâ€™d love to connect. You can
