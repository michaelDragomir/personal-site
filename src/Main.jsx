// 				I joined the Disney+ web team as a senior engineer slightly more
// 				than a year after Disney+ was launched. Some contributions I made
// 				included building out the age verification system used in South
// 				Korea, facilitated backward incompatible API migrations, and
// 				produced new releases and production deployments. Tech used included
// 				React, NodeJS and GraphQL. The next team I joined (Content
// 				Discovery) built the Disney Streaming Design System. It was a fun
// 				project that included building a standalone multi-variant NPM
// 				package currently still in use. In addition to building the tool, we
// 				scoured every nook and cranny of the Disney+ codebase integrating
// 				the design system, one CSS class at a time. Tech used here was
// 				primarily SASS and NodeJS. More recently Iâ€™ve been fortunate enough
// 				to work on and lead greenfield projects covering a variety of
// 				codebases and platforms, including mobile and TV devices. Projects
// 				that I hope I can share with the world soon. Motortrend (Discovery
// 				Communications) 2018 - 2020 I joined Motortrend right after
// 				Discovery acquired the business in 2018. <br />I was the 4th hire on
// 				the Connected Devices team and represented JavaScript platforms.
// 				During my time at Motortrend, I had the privilege of working on
// 				Discoveryâ€™s custom TV framework that powered all their browser-based
// 				TVs, STBs, and gaming consoles. I built the Motortrend On Demand
// 				streaming app using this framework for Xbox, Android TV, FireTV,
// 				Comcast STBs, and Samsung. I also maintained a high traffic
// 				multi-variant React Native app called Buyer's Guide and Automobile.
// 				During this time I also supported Discovery brands like the
// 				Eurosport Player, Food Network Kitchen and worked on the Discovery+
// 				AdTech SDK (living room devices) during its development as a
// 				maintainer/ contributor of the core framework. <br />
// 				HOTB Software 2017 - 2018 HOTB Software is a software and investment
// 				firm that helps get startups off the ground. I was hired as a React
// 				Native developer and built a cross-platform iOS/Android app called
// 				FlipTix, a platform that "flips" time left on live event tickets. I
// 				architected and built the mobile app, and handled the app store
// 				submissions and internal enterprise distributions. Topflight Apps
// 				Early 2017 Topflight Apps was my first coding gig. I worked mostly
// 				on Wordpress sites, extending themes, improving UI or fixing bugs. I
// 				also migrated a MySQL database which scared me to death at the time.
// 				Till this day I am grateful to Joe Tuan for this opportunity, he
// 				took the risk and hired a self-taught dev and it changed the course
// 				of my life significantly. Development I enjoy building for the
// 				frontend. I love learning about consumer devices and the hardware
// 				that powers them. Building for such a variety of devices has
// 				ultimately made me a better developer. If youâ€™ve built for Samsung
// 				2016 TVs, Iâ€™m sure you would agree ðŸ˜‰. <br />I use React for
// 				building UIs when not building for TV. I am familiar with it and its
// 				inner workings. I have tried building a renderer for it in Rust,
// 				using Netflixâ€™s React Gibbon (C++ with a JS view layer architecture)
// 				as inspiration, but Rustâ€™s memory safeness made it very difficult.
// 				For better or worse, I have learned a lot from React and it has
// 				influenced my frontend work more than any other codebase. Iâ€™ve been
// 				playing around with Svelteâ€™s Repl though, and am intrigued to learn
// 				more. There was a time where <br />I was excited about building the
// 				entire stack from the ground up, but these days services like Vercel
// 				and Netlify make it too easy to build, deploy and manage something
// 				quick (for personal projects of course). Iâ€™ve used NextJS
// 				extensively both at Disney and in my side projects. I built
// 				ask-carl.com using NextJS deployed to Vercel, and my current project
// 				bugchain.io is built with RedwoodJS and deployed to Vercel as well.
// 				I have built my own self-hosted infrastructure and deployment/data
// 				pipelines too, mostly on AWS. Redwood is an opinionated framework
// 				built on React, Node, GraphQL, and Prisma and has quite literally
// 				reduced my coding time by half (a single command builds the REST
// 				endpoints, forms, and GraphQL queries for a given database model). I
// 				am a big fan of functional programming. I am by no means a master,
// 				but I apply concepts like composition, piping, and point-free in my
// 				work whenever possible. JavaScriptâ€™s feature of creating closures
// 				lends itself beautifully to the FP paradigm. I also like RxJS (and
// 				reactive programming in general), it is one of the best libraries
// 				Iâ€™ve used and extremely useful for event-driven (like video players)
// 				programs. Tooling-wise, Iâ€™ve been using Rollup for standalone NPM
// 				libraries and packages, and Vite (love it!) for applications and
// 				sites, but Iâ€™ve used Webpack more in production (Webpack + Yarn
// 				Workspaces = awesome DX). Contact If youâ€™re looking for a solid
// 				frontend staff level engineer for your team or a technical
// 				co-founder to build an impressive MVP Iâ€™d love to connect. You can
